This is a beginner-level Python project designed to show how data collection works in the world of IoT (Internet of Things). Since I don't have a physical sensor yet, this program "simulates" one by generating its own data.

✨ Key Features
Data Generation: It creates realistic temperature readings automatically.

Smart Storage: It organizes all the readings into a list for easy access.

Basic Analytics: The program automatically calculates the highest, lowest, and average temperatures.

Simple Logic: It demonstrates how "raw data" can be turned into useful information.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: The core language used for all logic and calculations.

🧠 What I Learned
While building this, I practiced several fundamental programming concepts:

Lists & Variables: How to store and manage multiple pieces of information.

Loops: How to process data sequences efficiently.

Basic Math in Python: Using logic to find maximums, minimums, and averages.

🚀 Future Goals
I plan to keep improving this project by:

Saving the data into a text file or Excel sheet.

Creating charts and graphs to visualize the temperature changes.

Connecting it to a real Arduino or Raspberry Pi sensor.
